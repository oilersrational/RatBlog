      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student. Relatively stats-inclined, certainly for the field I&amp;rsquo;m in. New to applying that knowledge to hockey. Oiler fan since &amp;lsquo;06, not nearly as long as my dad. Proud citizen of the MÃ©tis Nation. Find me on Twitter @OilersRational.
Oh, and my &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo; key sticks, so excuse the doublees.

      <title>What Points System Should the NHL be Using?</title>

      <description>Recently, a post made the rounds on Twitter asking what NHL rule changes people would make if given the opportunity. Several people suggested a change to the NHL points system. And I very strongly agree with this sentiment; in my opinion, the current point system obscures the actual hierarchy of team quality by rewarding teams too much for losing. At present, the NHL awards two points for a win of any type, and a single point for a loss in overtime or a shootout.</description>
