I'm a PhD student. Relatively stats-inclined, certainly for the field I'm in. New to applying that knowledge to hockey. Oiler fan since '06, not nearly as long as my dad. Proud citizen of the MÃ©tis Nation. Find me on Twitter [@OilersRational](https://twitter.com/OilersRational).

Oh, and my 'e' key sticks, so excuse the doublees.
